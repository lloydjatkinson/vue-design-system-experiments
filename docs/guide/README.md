# Introduction

The goal of this project is to be a reference point/guide for design system and component library implementations.

It aims to have reference implementations of various concepts, simple to advanced, that often come up during the implemenations of design systems, component libraries, advanced reusable components, etc.

Vue is the main focus of this documentation. It will be using various other sources as existing literature. Some of these might not even use Vue (such as Web Component based ones). The idea is to be a source of "Aha! So that is how XYZ design system has implemented component FooBar!".
